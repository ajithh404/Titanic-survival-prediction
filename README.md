# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction

## 📝 Project Overview
This project predicts passenger survival on the **Titanic** using multiple machine learning algorithms. The dataset is preprocessed, and various models are trained and evaluated.

## 📌 Implemented Algorithms
- 🏡 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- 🎯 **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- 🌳 **Decision Tree**
- 🌲 **Random Forest**
- ⚡ **AdaBoost**
